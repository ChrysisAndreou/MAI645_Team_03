* Contains the full set of code, output, and model weights.
* A dedicated subfolder called **`final weights`** is included for easy access to the final trained model weights.
* For ease of sharing, all necessary files have been transferred into the above folder named **`mai645_project_for_sharing`**.

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> All file paths in the Google Colab notebooks reference their original locations in **`My Drive`** **only when using the** `mai645_project_for_sharing` **folder**. If you're using the `mai645_project_for_sharing` folder, **you must move its contents into `My Drive`** in your own Google Drive for the code to function correctly. 
> This requirement does **not** apply to the **`mai645_project_outputs`** folder.
